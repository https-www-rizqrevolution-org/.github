Important:

This information is subject to change without notice.
For product-specific information about APIs, refer to the Help Center content for that product.
Step 1: Open connectivity ports
Open the following ports:

Port	Purpose
TCP port 443 (HTTPS)	Access the main URLs for authentication and API call
TCP port 80 (HTTP)	Allow CRL and OCSP checks (Step 4 below)
Notes:

Depending on your setup and the application, you might need to allow additional rules.
If you're using a Microsoft Windows client, you might need to allow these rules on a per-application basis. For details, consult your Microsoft documentation.

Expand section  |  Collapse all & go to top

CRL check
A Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is a list of digital certificates revoked by the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) before their scheduled expiration date. These certificates should not be trusted.

An HTTP (not HTTPS) URL on the CA website typically sends a CRL. The CRL distribution points are visible in the certificate X509v3 details.

Here are the current CRL distribution points that are in use for Google services:

http://crl.pki.goog
http://crls.pki.goog
For details, go to Google Trust Services.

OCSP check
The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an internet protocol used for obtaining the revocation status of an X.509 digital certificate.

Current OCSP distribution point in use for Google services: http://ocsp.pki.goog
